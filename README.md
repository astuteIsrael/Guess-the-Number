# Guess the Number Game

## Overview

This project is a simple Python-based "Guess the Number" game. The goal of the game is for the player to correctly guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100. After each guess, the game will provide feedback to help the player make the next guess, indicating whether the guessed number is too high or too low. Once the player correctly guesses the number, the game will display the total number of attempts made.

## How It Works

- The game generates a random number between 1 and 100.
- The player is prompted to guess the number.
- After each guess, the game provides feedback:
  - If the guess is too low, it says "Too low. Try again."
  - If the guess is too high, it says "Too high. Try again."
  - If the guess is correct, it says "Congratulations!" and ends the game.
- The game tracks the number of attempts and displays them when the correct guess is made.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

No external libraries are required for this project as it uses the built-in `random` library.

## Usage

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the `guess_the_number.py` file is located.
3. Run the script using the following command:
    ```bash
    python guess_the_number.py
    ```
4. The game will prompt you to enter your guesses until the correct number is found.
